# Requirements to run
This program requires the install of the following:
```
    pytorch, cython, numpy and matplotlib
```

# How to run the program
Use this command to run the test of the program
```
    python performance_test.py
```

To run the program with the visualizations this variable has to be ```True``` in the relevant file(cythonfn.pyx, pytorchfn.py or activematter.py):
```
    plotRealTime = True
```

# Results
The results of from the test will be written to the /data folder with the name of the file corresponding the the test and the line of the result corresponding to the size of the input data.
